# Jason's Chat App

This is a Typescript [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) using Firebase 9 for the backend of which the first commit's code in this repo was created in about a day's time. It is deployed to Vercel [here](https://jasons-chat-app.vercel.app/login).

It is a multi-user text-based chat app. You can register an account and then select and chat with the other users who have registered. The app has public and private pages and you must be logged in to access the chat page.

The project dependencies are managed by `yarn` and so after installing them you can run the app locally by running `yarn start`. The demo test cases I added for the login page can be run with `yarn test` and then press `a` to run them all. The app was written using `eslint` standards, `prettier` for formatting the code, and conventional commits.
